API GATEWAY DEMO
================

This is an example of how to set up a test environment for an Nginx gateway, with tests
implemented using [Ruby Rspec](http://rspec.info/).

Please read our blog posts [Lightweight Tests for your Nginx API Gateway](http://underthehood.meltwater.com/blog/2017/12/12/lightweight-tests-for-your-nginx-api-gateway/) to understand the details of our testing approach.

# Prerequisites
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [ruby 2.4.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2016/12/25/ruby-2-4-0-released/)
* [bundler](http://bundler.io/)

# Project structure explained
~~~bash
├── nginx (Gateway configuration)
│   ├── conf.d
│   │   └── api-gateway.conf (Location directives)
│   ├── dns.conf (DNS resolver)
│   └── nginx.conf (Main config)
└── tests
    ├── hosts
    │   └── hosts (DNS resolutions for internal services)
    ├── nginx
    │   ├── conf.d
    │   │   └── services.conf (Internal services mock)
    │   └── dns.conf (Test DNS resolver)
~~~

Setting up the test docker container required 4 extra steps on top of the target Nginx setup:
* Install and run `dnsmasq` (Step 1)
* Override `/etc/hosts` file with DNS names for our internal services (Step 2)
* Override production DNS resolver and inject virtual server configuration mocking internal services (Step 3)
* Include self signed ssl certificate used in internal services mock (Step 4)

~~~dockerfile
# Production config
COPY nginx/*                        /etc/nginx/
COPY nginx/conf.d/*                 /etc/nginx/conf.d/

# Test setup

# Step 1
RUN apt-get update; apt-get install dnsmasq -y

# Step 2 - we can not directly copy it to /etc/hosts since docker will
# regenerate the file and overwrite our changes. We will copy content from
# /etc/test.hosts to /etc/hosts on runtime in launch.sh script
COPY tests/hosts/hosts                /etc/test.hosts

# Step 3
COPY tests/nginx                      /etc/nginx/

# Step 4
COPY tests/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt   /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
COPY tests/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key   /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key
~~~

# Run tests
Set up testing environment:
~~~bash
$ make compose-up-test
~~~

Execute tests:
~~~bash
$ make test
~~~
